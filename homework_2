The first part is mainly about the handling of defects. Processing defects should be divided into the following steps:
find defects, defect classification, to take a different approach to treatment based on defect categories, finally, 
I think is the teacher emphasised in class: Tracking defects after treatment. I think the last step for the domestic 
software companies may have little to do or not do this. This is a very important step, we need to pay more  attention.

The second part of the study is the quality improvement paradigm. Theorys in the book is the quality of management 
theory  which is summarized in the overall guidance of the problem. Facing the real problems, we need to make different 
solutions based on different situations.

The third part introduces the relevant techniques of test. Courses at the university  have studied the relevant 
knowledges.Graduate courses (such as poject management,sortware engineering) have repeatedly referred to the testing 
technology.We can see that test play a very important role in SQA.
