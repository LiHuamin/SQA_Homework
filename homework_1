                                               Software Quality Assurance

   I think Software Quality Assurance is very important and related to the existence of the software.QA encompasses the entire software development process, which includes processes such as requirements definition, software design, coding, source code control, code reviews, change management, configuration management, testing, release management, and product integration. SQA is organized into goals, commitments, abilities, activities, measurements, and verifications.
