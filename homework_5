Formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based techniques for the specification, development and verification 
of software and hardware systems.[1] The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the 
expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the 
reliability and robustness of a design.

Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals,
in particular logic calculi, formal languages, automata theory, and program semantics, but also type systems and algebraic 
data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.
